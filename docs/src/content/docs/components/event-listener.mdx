Event Listener is a component that allows you to hook up events from a [scriptable event](../../types/scriptable-event/) in the inspector.

## Usage

Assign a scriptable event to the `Target Event` field of the component. 

Then pick when you want to start listening. You can pick between `Awake`, `Start`, and `OnEnable`.

- `Awake`: The event will be triggered when the value changes in the `Awake` method.
- `Start`: The event will be triggered when the value changes in the `Start` method.
- `OnEnable`: The event will be triggered when the value changes in the `OnEnable` method.

Then pick when you want to stop listening. You can pick between `OnDestroy` and `OnDisable`.

- `OnDestroy`: The event will be triggered when the value changes in the `OnDestroy` method.
- `OnDisable`: The event will be triggered when the value changes in the `OnDisable` method.

After that you can pick when you want the events to be triggered. You can pick between `Any`, `From Value`, and `To Value`.

- `Any`: The event will be triggered any time the event is invoked.
- `From Value`: The event will be triggered when the event is invoked from the value you set in the inspector.
- `To Value`: The event will be triggered when the event is invoked to the value you set in the inspector.

:::note
`Invoke On` does not exist on event listeners without arguments.

## Extending

Event Listeners are extended by inheriting from the [`ScriptableEventListener<T>`](../../reference/hertzole.scriptablevalues.scriptableeventlistener-1/) class. This will allow you to create your own event listeners for your own types. 

```csharp title="MyEventListener.cs"
using Hertzole.ScriptableValues;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyEventListener : ScriptableEventListener<MyValueType>
{
    // Simple as that!
}
```

You can also override methods based around the invoking of events.

```csharp title="MyEventListener.cs"
using Hertzole.ScriptableValues;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyEventListener : ScriptableEventListener<MyValueType>
{
    protected override bool OnBeforeEventInvoked(object sender, MyValueType args)
    {
        // Do something before the event is invoked.
        return true; // Return false to cancel the invocation.
    }

    protected override void OnEventInvoked(object sender, MyValueType args)
    {
        // Do something after the event is invoked.
    }
}
```
