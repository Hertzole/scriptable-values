`ScriptableList<T>` is a type of scriptable object that holds a list of values. It acts just like a regular [`List<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1), but it is a scriptable object that can be used in the inspector and be passed around to other objects.

`ScriptableGameObjectList` is already included in the package and can be used to create a list of game objects. But it may be more useful to create your own list for a specific component. See [Creating a List](#creating-a-list) for more information.

`ScriptableList<T>` implements `IList<T>`, `IReadOnlyList<T>`, and `IList`. However, it does not always expose those implemented methods. To access them you need to explicitly cast the list to the interface you want to use.

## Usage

Using a Scriptable List in your code is really straight forward. You use the `Add`, `Remove`, and `Clear` methods to manage the list.
:::note
To actually asign the list to a field you need to create an instance of the list in the editor. These instances need to be created in code first. See [Creating a List](#creating-a-list) for more information.
:::

`Add` will add an object to the list.

```csharp title="Add Example"
using UnityEngine;
using Hertzole.ScriptableValues;

public class Inventory : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] 
    private ScriptableList<Item> items;

    public void AddItem(Item item)
    {
        items.Add(item);
    }
}
```

`Remove` will remove an object from the list.

```csharp title="Remove Example"
using UnityEngine;
using Hertzole.ScriptableValues;

public class Inventory : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] 
    private ScriptableList<Item> items;

    public void RemoveItem(Item item)
    {
        items.Remove(item);
    }
}
```

`Clear` will remove all objects from the list. This is useful for cleaning up the list when it is no longer needed, like when quitting or changing scenes.

```csharp title="Clear Example"
using UnityEngine;
using Hertzole.ScriptableValues;

public class Inventory : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] 
    private ScriptableList<Item> items;

    public void Clear()
    {
        items.Clear();
    }
}
```

You can also access the list directly using the `Value` property. This will return the list of values, which you can use just like a regular list.

```csharp title="Indexer Example"
using UnityEngine;
using Hertzole.ScriptableValues;

public class Inventory : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] 
    private ScriptableList<Item> items;

    public void PrintItems()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < items.Value.Count; i++)
        {
            Debug.Log(items.Value[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

You can listen to changes in the list using the `OnCollectionChanged` event.

```csharp title="Listening Example"
using UnityEngine;
using Hertzole.ScriptableValues;
using System.Collections.Specialized;

public class Inventory : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] 
    private ScriptableList<Item> items;

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        items.OnCollectionChanged += OnListChanged;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        items.OnCollectionChanged -= OnListChanged;
    }

    private void OnListChanged(CollectionChangedArgs<Item> args)
    {
        // Action is a NotifyCollectionChangedAction
        Debug.Log("Action: " + args.Action);
        // New Index is the index of the item(s) that was added
        Debug.Log("New Index: " + args.NewIndex);
        // Old Index is the index of the item(s) that was removed
        Debug.Log("Old Index: " + args.OldIndex);
        // New Items is the item(s) that was added as a Memory<T>
        Debug.Log("New Items: " + args.NewItems);
        // Old Items is the item(s) that was removed as a Memory<T>
        Debug.Log("Old Items: " + args.OldItems);
    }
}
```

There are many more methods available on the list, such as `Contains`, `IndexOf`, and `Sort`. It aims to have full parity with the regular `List<T>` class. See the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1) for more information.

### Listening to Collections

<CollectionEvent/>

## Properties

The following properties are available on all Scriptable List:

### Is Read Only

<DefaultValue enabled={false}/>
Marks the scriptable list as read-only. This means that the list cannot be changed at runtime and will always have the same value. This is useful for lists that are set in the editor and should not be changed at runtime.

### Set Equality Check

<DefaultValue enabled={true}/>
When this is enabled `OnCollectionChanged` will not be triggered when a list item is set to the same value as it already has. This is useful for lists that are set frequently and should not trigger the events when the value is the same.

### Clear On Start

<DefaultValue enabled={true}/>
Clears the list when the game starts. This is useful for lists that should be cleared when the game starts, such as a list of enemies. Disabling this will keep the list from the last play session.
:::caution
This does not mean that the list will be saved! Restarting the Unity editor will clear the list. It will just persist between editor play sessions.
:::

### Capacity

The capacity of the list. This is the number of items that can be stored in the list before it needs to be resized. This can be set before adding a bunch of items to the list to avoid resizing the list multiple times. This is useful for performance reasons.

### Count

The actual number of items in the list.

## Creating a List

You need to create a list first before you can use it in the editor. Fortunately, this is really easy to do! All you need to do is inherit from `ScriptableList<T>`.

```csharp title="Creating a List"
using UnityEngine;
using Hertzole.ScriptableValues;

[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "New Item List", menuName = "Scriptable Values/Item List")]
public class ItemList : ScriptableList<Item>
{
    // You can add any custom functionality here if you want.
    // There are no methods to override, but you can add your own methods.
}
```
