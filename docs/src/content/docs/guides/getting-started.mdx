Getting started with Scriptable Values is really easy! Everything you need to get started is in the Create Asset menu. You can also create your own types of runtime scriptable objects, but that is covered in the [Creating Custom Types](/scriptable-values/guides/creating-custom-types) guide.

Now you must decide what you want to start with!
