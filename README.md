# Scriptable Values

## ‚ùì What is this?

Scriptable Values allow you to use scriptable objects for reactive values, events, and collections instead of normal C# events and singletons.

You also don't need to care about values being saved between sessions as they are cleared before you enter play mode, but this is also customizable!

## ‚ú® Features

### Scriptable Values

Scriptable Values allow you to have a single value across multiple objects and listen to its changing events.  
There are scriptable values for all primitive C# values that you can use out of the box, but it's not difficult to create your own.

#### Scriptable Values Usage

**Basic usage:**    
```cs
public class PlayerHealth : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ScriptableInt health;

    public void TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        health.Value -= damage;
    }
}

public class HealthUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ScriptableInt health;
    public Text healthText;

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        health.OnValueChanged += OnHealthChanged;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        health.OnValueChanged -= OnHealthChanged;
    }

    private void OnHealthChanged(int oldValue, int newValue)
    {
        healthText.text = "Health: " + newValue.ToString();
    }
}
```

**Creating your own scriptable value:**  
```cs
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "New Scriptable Vector3", menuName = "My Values/Scriptable Vector3")]
public class ScriptableVector3 : ScriptableValue<Vector3> 
{
    // Nothing more, it's as simple as that!
}
```

### Scriptable Events

Scriptable Events aim to replace normal C# events and the requirement to know the object they come from. With scriptable events, an event can come from anywhere but you are still able to know where if needed.

#### Scriptable Events Usage

**Basic usage:**   
```cs 
public class PlayerHealth : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ScriptableIntEvent onHealthChanged;

    private int currentHealth = 100;

    public void TakeDamage(int damage)
    {
        currentHealth -= damage;
        onHealthChanged.Invoke(this, currentHealth);
    }
}

public class HealthUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ScriptableIntEvent onHealthChanged;
    public Text healthText;

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        onHealthChanged.OnInvoked += OnHealthChanged;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        onHealthChanged.OnInvoked -= OnHealthChanged;
    }

    private void OnHealthChanged(object sender, int args)
    {
        healthText.text = "Health: " + args.ToString();
    }
}
```

**Creating your own scriptable event:**    
```cs
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "New Scriptable Vector3 Event", menuName = "My Events/Scriptable Vector3")]
public class ScriptableVector3Event : ScriptableEvent<Vector3> 
{
    // Nothing more, it's as simple as that!
}
```

### Scriptable Collections

There are two scriptable collections that you can inherit from, list and dictionary, to create collections that you can use across your objects.  
There's also a premade ScriptableGameObjectList that you can use to store game objects.

#### Scriptable collections usage

**Basic list usage:**    
```cs
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "New Scriptable String List", menuName = "My Lists/Scriptable String List")]
public class ScriptableStringList : ScriptableList<string> {}

public class MessageHandler : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ScriptableStringList messageList;

    public void AddMessage(string message)
    {
        messageList.Add(message);
    }
}

public class MessageUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ScriptableStringList messageList;
    public Text textPrefab;

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        messageList.OnAdded += OnMessageAdded;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        messageList.OnAdded -= OnMessageAdded;
    }

    private void OnMessageAdded(string newMessage)
    {
        Text text = Instantiate(textPrefab);
        text.text = newMessage;
    }
}
```

**Basic dictionary usage:**    
```cs
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "New Scriptable Player Dictionary", menuName = "My Dictionaries/Scriptable Player Dictionary")]
public class ScriptablePlayerDictionary : ScriptableDictionary<int, GameObject> {}

public class PlayerID : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int myId;
    public ScriptablePlayerDictionary playersDictionary;

    private void Awake()
    {
        playersDictionary.Add(myId, gameObject);
    }
}

public class PlayersUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ScriptablePlayerDictionary playersDictionary;
    public Text textPrefab;

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        playersDictionary.OnAdded += OnPlayerAdded;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        playersDictionary.OnAdded -= OnPlayerAdded;
    }

    private void OnPlayerAdded(int key, GameObject value)
    {
        Text text = Instantiate(textPrefab);
        text.text = $"Player {key}: {value}";
    }
}
```
